# 🧠 DRIA – Deep Research and Intelligence Agent
![logo](dria.png)
**A local-first voice assistant that multitasks like no other.**

---

### 🎙️ Talk to DRIA like a friend.  
While she silently conducts **deep research** in the background.

> Imagine asking your assistant to research a technical topic —  
> and casually switching to talk about lunch — without breaking flow.

## 🚀 What Makes DRIA Different?

Most assistants either:
- Go **silent** while they "think"
- Or give you **surface-level** responses fast

**DRIA does both.**
- 🧠 Performs **deep research** using Firecrawl (in a Docker container)
- 🔍 Uses **Perplexica** for quick, AI-powered local web searches
- 🗣️ Keeps chatting with you in real-time using **Mistral AI (3.1 small)** via Ollama
- 🎧 Fully **voice-enabled** via Faster-Whisper STT & Kokoro-82M TTS
- 🧩 Built on **LiveKit Voice Agent** + custom scripts
- 🔒 100% **local and private** – no data ever leaves your machine
